# Image Uploader Web App

This project is a web application that allows users to upload images to a cloud storage service (Cloudinary), tracks the number of times an image has been viewed, and displays this information on the frontend. The app uses **React** for the frontend, **Express** for the backend, and **Redux** for state management.

## Features

- Upload images in **JPEG**, **JPG**, or **PNG** format.
- Store images in **Cloudinary**.
- Display uploaded images with the option to copy the link.
- Track and display the number of times an image has been viewed.
- Manage image state using **Redux**.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React** (with Hooks)
- **Redux** for state management
- **Axios** for API requests
- **CSS** for styling

### Backend:
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**
- **Multer** for handling file uploads
- **Cloudinary** for image storage
- **CORS** for cross-origin requests

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/image-uploader.git
   cd image-uploader


# Getting Started with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
