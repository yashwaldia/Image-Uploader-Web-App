# Image Uploader Web App

This project is a web application that allows users to upload images to a cloud storage service (Cloudinary), tracks the number of times an image has been viewed, and displays this information on the frontend. The app uses **React** for the frontend, **Express** for the backend, and **Redux** for state management.

## Features

- Upload images in **JPEG**, **JPG**, or **PNG** format.
- Store images in **Cloudinary**.
- Display uploaded images with the option to copy the link.
- Track and display the number of times an image has been viewed.
- Manage image state using **Redux**.
